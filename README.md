# Mehvish Ashiq

I have been in writing field since 2019 with over 3 years of technical writing experience, which includes:

- Researching and Creating Technical Content
- Writing Programming Tutorials and Blogs
- Working on How-to and Installation Guides
- Collaborating with Company Founders and Editors' Team

I am currently working as a Technical Writer on Upwork. Over the past few years, I have worked with tools and technologies to write technical tutorials, blogs, articles, and how-to guides. You can best describe me as “*A technical writer who appreciates the depth of technology and isn’t afraid to dive deeper when required.*”

I worked as a Java Programmer on Fiverr; however, I enjoy writing about technology more rather than working on technology. For the past few months, I've been exploring technical documentation to move one step ahead in technical writing.
